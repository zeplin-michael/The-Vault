# Secure the Vault

You have been hired to secure a vault! You must ensure that the client's family heirlooms are stored safely. In this workshop, you will write JavaScript to correctly set the codes for the vault's combination lock.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository under your GitHub account using this one as a template.
2. Clone your repository down to your local machine and open it with VS Code.
3. Live serve `index.html` and open the browser console.

## Instructions

In `index.js`, write JavaScript according to the following steps. Make sure the JS file is connected to the HTML file!

1. Declare a variable named `code1`.
2. In a separate statement, assign `code1` to an expression that evaluates to `10`. Use the numbers `7` and `3` and an arithmetic operator.
3. In one statement, initialize another variable named `code2` to have a value of `40`. The `40` must be calculated using three numbers and the subtraction and division operators.
4. Create another variable named `code3` with a value of `39`. The `39` should be calculated using at least one modulo operator.
5. Initialize a variable named `message` to have the value `"The vault has been secured. The combination is:`.
6. Initialize a variable named `codeA` to have the value `"10-40-39"`. This value must be calculated by concatenating the variables `code1`, `code2`, and `code3`.
7. Initialize a variable named `codeB` to have the value `"10-40-39"`. The value must be a single [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) that uses the variables `code1`, `code2`, and `code3`.
8. Use `console.log` to print `message`, `codeA`, and `codeB` to the browser console.
